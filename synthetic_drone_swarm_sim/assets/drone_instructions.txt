Drone Image Instructions
========================

Place your drone image file as "drone.png" in this directory.

Requirements:
- File name: drone.png
- Format: PNG (with transparency/alpha channel)
- Content: Side or angled view of a drone
- Resolution: Recommended 200x200 to 500x500 pixels
- Background: Transparent (alpha channel)

The drone image should have a transparent background so it can be properly
alpha-blended onto the background video. A clear, detailed drone silhouette
works best for the simulation.
