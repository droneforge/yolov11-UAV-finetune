Background Video Instructions
============================

Place your background video file as "background.mp4" in this directory.

Requirements:
- File name: background.mp4
- Format: MP4
- Content: Empty scene with sky
- Duration: Recommended 5-30 seconds
- Resolution: Any (720p or 1080p recommended)

The background video should show an open sky or landscape without any moving objects,
as this will serve as the base for overlaying the drone swarm simulation.
